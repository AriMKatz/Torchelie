"""
Recipes are a way to provide off the shelf algorithms that ce be either used
directly from the command line or easily imported in a python script if more
flexibility is needed.

A recipe should, as much a possible, be agnostic of the data and the underlying
model so that it can be used as a way to quickly try an algorithm on new data
or be easily experimented on by changing the model
